## Development Experience

### Buoy Call Web Application
#### [https://github.com/andimiya/buoy-call](https://github.com/andimiya/buoy-call)
##### April 2017
- Collaborated with 3 other students to create an application which found and displayed historical buoy data as well plotted both buoys and sharks on a map. Users were able to interact with the application by clicking on any buoy to view graphed data, and could also select a shark on the map and name it by making a five dollar donation.

#### Contributions to this project include:
- Creating the database schemas for our buoy data and buoy coordinates data.
- Writing of bash scripts to collect data from various webpages, create csv files, adjust headers and file contents to be importable into our database, then import the data into PostgreSQL.
- Stripe implementation on both the server-side and client-side so our application could receive real credit card donations.
- Deployment of the application which involved nginx, pm2, the configuration and setup of two Digital Ocean droplets (one for our database and one for our application), and  implementation of LetsEncrypt.
